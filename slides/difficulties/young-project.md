# Young Project

- Working with software
- Lack of documentation
- Open Source project

<!--
Working with software: Not like working on code. Only able to use what developper make configurable at run time
Lack of documentation -> Need to read code to understand how its work
OpenSource : open issues, provide way to reproduce bug, investigate old issues
-->
